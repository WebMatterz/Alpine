                       <strong> COUNTRY AT A GLANCE: KENYA </strong>
                      <br>
                      Located halfway down the east coast of Africa, astride the equator, Kenya is the most accessible country in the region. Kenya is the home of the safari and one of the world’s top holiday destinations. The words Jambo and Karibu, meaning hello and welcome are traditionally the first words to greet visitors to Africa. Kenya offers a world of attractions, much more than any other destination. It has stunning landscapes, cultural diversity, adventure sports, beautiful beaches and its unique wildlife.  
                      <br>
                      What makes Kenya fascinating as a wildlife destination is the sheer diversity of its many game parks. One of the greatest sights is the annual migration of two million wildebeests – together with half a million zebras and thousands of gazelles across the endless savannah. From the small Shimba Hills National Park, down to the coast, to the bleak wilderness of Lake Turkana in the north, the rolling hills of the Masai Mara – home of the migration, the enormous Tsavo, Kenya has an entire world of amazing parks to see and experience. 
                      <br>
                      At the same time, Kenya has maintained its exclusivity. In any case the country has such a wide array of game parks that most are not crowded and some are rarely visited except on the most dedicated wildlife enthusiasts. 
                      <br>
                      After the wonders of the safari experience, Kenya’s beaches offer the ultimate in relaxation. For those in search of adventure and sports, Kenya is the perfect destination with over 480 km of beach, big game fishing off Mombasa, mountain climbing, rapid rivers for water rafting, or playing golf at one of the nearly 40 courses. 
                        <br>
                          Visitors to Kenya are exposed to vibrant and various and cultures of Kenya as we have over forty local tribes. You will share in their ancient musical traditions and experience a unique kind of hospitality.

                        <strong> COUNTRY AT A GLANCE: ETHIOPIA </strong>
                        <strong> Geography/ Topography </strong>
                        <br>
                        Ethiopia is the 10th largest country in Africa and has an area of 1.112,000 square kilometers, about 60 percent of - which is arable, with 15 percent presently cultivated. The dominant feature is the high central plateau varying in height between 2000 and 3000 meters, with some mountains over 4000 meters. The country has numerous rivers, most notably the Blue Nile (or Abbay). The Rift Valley Splits Ethiopia diagonally. 
                         <br>
                         <strong> History </strong>
                         Archeologists have found the oldest known human ancestors in Ethiopia, including Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba (c. 5.8–5.2 million years old) and Australopithecus anamensis (c. 4.2 million years old). Originally called Abyssinia, Ethiopia is sub-Saharan Africa's oldest state, and its Solomonic dynasty claims descent from King Menelik I, traditionally believed to have been the son of the queen of Sheba and King Solomon. The current nation is a consolidation of smaller kingdoms that owed feudal allegiance to the Ethiopian emperor. 
                         <br>
                         Hamitic peoples migrated to Ethiopia from Asia Minor in prehistoric times. Semitic traders from Arabia penetrated the region in the 7th century B.C. Its Red Sea ports were important to the Roman and Byzantine Empires. Coptic Christianity was brought to the region in A.D. 341, and a variant of it became Ethiopia's state religion. Ancient Ethiopia reached its peak in the 5th century, then was isolated by the rise of Islam and weakened by feudal wars. 
                          <br>
                          Haile Selassie, called the “Lion of Judah,” outlawed slavery and tried to centralize his scattered realm, in which 70 languages were spoken. In 1931, he created a constitution, revised in 1955, that called for a parliament with an appointed senate, an elected chamber of deputies, and a system of courts. But basic power remained with the emperor. 
                          <br>
                          Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia on Oct. 3, 1935, forcing Haile Selassie into exile in May 1936. Ethiopia was annexed to Eritrea, then an Italian colony, and to Italian Somaliland, forming Italian East Africa. In 1941, British troops routed the Italians, and Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa. In 1952, Eritrea was incorporated into Ethiopia.

                            <strong> COUNTRY AT A GLANCE: RWANDA </strong>
                            <br>
                            Rwanda is a small mountainous country in central Africa and is bordered to the north by Uganda, to the East by Tanzania, to the south by Burundi and to the west by the Democratic Republic of Congo. The country is divided by great peaks of up to 3000m (9842ft), which run across from north to south. Rwanda has good climate, vegetation, and it is no wonder that Rwanda is commonly referred to as ‘The Land of a Thousand Hills’. Rwanda’s tourism sector has rich and beautiful attractions. Among these are the Akagera and Nyungwe National parks, forests, various flora and fauna, and the famous Silverback Mountain Gorillas found in the Parc Nationale des Volcans or the Volcano National Park. 
                            <br>
                            The Virunga volcanoes, which are home to the world’s most endangered and famed Mountain Gorillas, rises steeply from Lake Kivu in the west, sloping down first to a hilly central plateau and further eastwards to an area of marshy lakes around the upper reaches of the Akagera River, the most remote source of the Nile, where the Akagera National Park is situated. Dominated scenically by the labyrinth of swamps and lakes that follow the meandering course of the Akagera River, this is archetypal African savannah landscape of tangled acacia woodland interspersed with open grassland.
                            <br>
                              Extending for 1,000 square kilometres across the majestic hills of southeast Rwanda, Nyungwe National Park is the largest block of montane forest in East or Central Africa, and one of the most ancient, dating back to before the last Ice Age. Nyungwe is most alluring for its primates, home to 13 species in all, including humankind’s closest living relative the chimpanzee, as well as the handsome L’Hoest’s monkey and harbours almost 300 bird species of which two dozen are restricted to a handful of montane forests on the Albertine Rift.
                            <br>
                            The Parc des Volcans protects the steep slopes of this magnificent mountain range - home of the rare Mountain Gorilla - and the rich mosaic of montane ecosystems, which embrace evergreen and bamboo forest, open grassland, swamp and heath. 
                            <br>
                            The bustling market town of Ruhengeri has a memorable setting at the base of the Virungas. On the outskirts of town, the natural bridge at Musanze - a solidified lava flow - is a fascinating relic of the volcanic activity that shaped this scenic area. Also within easy day tripping distance of Ruhengeri, are the seldom visited but lovely Lakes - Burera, Ruhondo and Karago. Ruhengeri offers a good selection of reasonably-priced small hotels and guest houses, including the newly 
                            renovated hotel, Gorilla's Nest. Visitors could also base themselves in Gisenyi or Kigali and - with an early start - head to the Parc des Volcans and Ruhengeri as a day trip.
                            <br>
                              Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia on Oct. 3, 1935, forcing Haile Selassie into exile in May 1936. Ethiopia was annexed to Eritrea, then an Italian colony, and to Italian Somaliland, forming Italian East Africa. In 1941, British troops routed the Italians, and Haile Selassie returned to Addis Ababa. In 1952, Eritrea was incorporated into Ethiopia.

                                <br>
                                Over centuries, the three socio-economic classes found in Rwanda, namely the Hutus, Tutsis and Twas, intermarried and many share clan linkages. Collectively, this helped to consolidate their commonality. Unfortunately, bad politics in the past failed to exploit this commonality as a basis for nation building. Instead, class distinctions were transformed into ethnic differences which were, in turn, used to sow seeds of alienation and exclusionism that led to the infamous genocide of 1994. 
                                <br>
                                Nothing defines Rwandese culture better than the warm hospitality of its people, the thrill of the Intore dancers and singers as well as the ordinary people’s strong ethic for work and industry. No wonder some have described Rwanda as the Land of a Million Smiles.

                              <strong> Language</strong> <br>
                              The country has three official languages, namely Kinyarwanda (vernacular), French and English. Most Rwandese are multi-lingual or at least bi-lingual. Swahili and other dialects from the region are also spoken, especially in major commercial centres.

                              <strong> Climate </strong> <br>
                             Rwanda is a tropical country; its high elevation makes the climate temperate. In the mountains, frost and snow are possible. The average daily temperature near Lake Kivu, at an altitude of 1,463 m is 23°C (73°F). Rwanda is considered the lightning capital of the world, due to intense daily thunderstorms during the two rainy seasons (February–May and September–December). Annual rainfall averages 31 inches but is generally heavier in the western and northwestern mountains than in the eastern savannas.

                              A certificate of yellow-fever vaccination is required. Much of Rwanda lies at too high an elevation for malaria to be a major concern, but the disease is present and prophylactic drugs are strongly recommended

                            <strong>What to bring </strong> <br> 
                            Binoculars will greatly enhance game drives and forest walks, as will a good field guide to East African birds. Bring a camera and an adequate stock of film. Print film is available but transparency film is not. Toiletries and other essentials can be bought in the cities. Dress codes are informal. Daytime temperatures are generally warm, so bring lots of light clothing, supplemented by light sweaters for the cool evenings and heavier clothing for the Parc des Volcans and Nyungwe. When tracking gorillas, it is advisable to wear sturdier clothing for protection against stinging nettles and solid walking shoes. A hat and sunglasses provide protection against the sun, and a waterproof jacket may come in handy in the moist mountains.

  <strong> COUNTRY AT A GLANCE: TANZANIA </strong>
          <br>
            Tanzania is one of the unique destinations on the African continent that has yet to be discovered by many. It is a land of many wonders, with an un-paralleled diversity of fauna and flora. Kilimanjaro, the highest permanently snow-capped free standing mountain in Africa, the exotic Islands of Zanzibar, the finest game sanctuaries of Serengeti, Tarangire, Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro Crater, Ruaha, Selous and the Marine Park of Mafia Island are only but a few of the living examples. The scenery, topography and very friendly people harbor the growth of excellent cultural tourism, beach holidays, game hunting, historical and archaeological ventures – and certainly the best wildlife photographic safaris on the continent. 
          <br>
          Tanzania is known for its vastness, its remote southern national parks and also for the parks scenic beauty as well as their abundance in wildlife. To the north of the country lies Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), about 828 Sq. Km, a perfect caldera of the world 18km in diameter. It borders Serengeti National Park, which arguably has the greatest concentration of wildlife in the world. 
          <br>
          Located in south-east Tanzania in a remote and little-visited part of the country, the Selous Game Reserve is Africa’s largest protected wildlife reserve and covers more than 5% of Tanzania’s total area.
            <br>
            Other National Parks in the south include Mahale (the haven of the chimpanzees and baboons); Mikumi, Mkomazi, rubondo, Katavi and Juvenile Udzungwa, rich in plant diversity and in colobus monkeys. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong> GENERAL INFORMATION - TANZANIA </strong> <br>
            Tanzania is country so wealthy that it would practically take years to document all the resources. Not only is the country proud to bear witness to the highest and largest free standing mountain in the world but also to the rich and diverse wildlife concentrations, mineral and other resources available. If Africa’s tourism opportunities were to be summarized by one single country that country would be Tanzania.

            <br><strong> COUNTRY AT A GLANCE: SEYCHELLES </strong>
            <br>
            Seychelles lies in the Indian Ocean, 1600kms off the east coast of Africa, between 4 and 10 ° south of the Equator.  Amongst the many islands the inner isles are largely granitic and situated on the Seychelles Plateau, Mahe, Praslin and La Digue and their neighbouring islands are the most frequented, offering the widest range of accommodation facilities, Frégate, Bird island and Denis, are a little more isolated and still fall under the inner islands group. The Outer islands located beyond the Seychelles Plateau; consist of mainly low-lying sand cays and coral atolls. Within this group only Desroches Island offers accommodation at present.  Desroches and Alphonse are renowned for fly-fishing.   
            <br>
            The islands enjoy a pleasant tropical climate year round.  The temperature seldom drops below 24 degrees or rises above 33 degrees centigrade. Globally changing climate conditions, however, make it difficult to predict exact weather patterns.
